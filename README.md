# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


# Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a scheduling application for day to day work.
* Displayed at the top of the browser is the current date and time of that given day
* The user is given time blocks for a typical work day, 9:00am-5:00pm
* Each time block has an input field that the user can enter an event or task into
* The time blocks are color coded based on the hour of the day:
  * If the time block is equal to the current hour of the day then the text area will have a red background color
  * If a time block is in the past, then the text area's background color of the time block(s) will be gray
  * If a time block is in the future, then the background color of the text area will be green
* When the user types in an event and then clicks on the save button, then that task that the user typed in, will be saved to the local storage
